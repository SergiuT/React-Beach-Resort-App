This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Beach Resort App

I created an application for a beach resort where you can see the rooms, the prices and also informations about the resort.
You can see the site [here](https://admiring-hawking-b2013c.netlify.com/).

### Home Page

In the home page I added a navbar with a title and 2 links Home and Rooms, also I added some services information, a banner with a button to the rooms page and some featured rooms displayed at the bottom.

### Rooms Page

On the rooms page I added a banner with the button to return home and the rooms that i stored in an object, also I added a filter on the page on wich you can change the type of the room (single, double triple), the number of the guests that fit in the room, a price value that you can change, and an option for the breakfast and pets, this way you can see the rooms with your search criteria.

### Feature Page

If you click on the button on any room image you'll be redirected to the information page, where you can see more photos of the room, and also details of the page like size, price, capacity.

### Technology Used

For this project I used react library, CSS, HTML and Bootstrap for styling.
